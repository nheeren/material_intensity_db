The foundations are shallow consisting mainly of continuous footings and are relatively small compared to the size of the building as the ground in Mount Lebanon is almost always rocky and provides a very high bearing capacity. This avoids the need for deep foundations as in other countries with poor soil conditions, such as Belgium or the Netherlands. The foundations support RC columns and walls which support the slabs, typically about 250 mm thick. The latter are constituted by embedded primary beams (about 800 mm wide on average) resting on the RC columns and walls which in turn support secondary beams (called ribs) that run perpendicular to the primary beams. These ribs are about 150mm wide and separated by 400mmwide gaps filled with hollow concrete blocks 180 mm high topped by a 70 mm thick compressive slab. The hollow blocks and reinforcement steel are first placed on the wooden formwork before casting the ready mix concrete. The outer walls are double concrete blocks walls with an air blade in between.
